            "text": "In our first few API requests, we already knew which ORCID iD to use (our own!) and we read/searched public information, which didn't require any permission from the user. In practice, you'll need to gather up iDs for researchers whose ORCID records you want to read, update, or associate with records in your own system AND get permission to take certain actions, like adding information to their ORCID records. In this section, we'll look at a few ways to get authenticated iDs and/or record access permission.\n\n\nAuthenticated iDs\n\n\nORCID is about disambiguation,it's important that you get the correct iD for each researcher. The best way to do this is to collect \nAuthenticated ORCID iDs\n, which means that each researcher signs into their ORCID account and authorizes your system to obtain their iD. \nLearn more about Authenticated iDs\n\n\nRecord access permission\n\n\nControl over access to data in your ORCID record is one of \nORCID's core princples\n. While you can read public ORCID data without the record owner's involvement, some API actions require permission:\n\n\n\n\nGet an Authenticated ORCID iD\n\n\nRead non-public data (items with privacy set to 'Trusted parties')\n\n\nAdd/update record data\n\n\n\n\nCustom integration\n\n\nThe most customizable way to get Authenticated iDs is by building your own API integration. In this section, we'll walk through the steps that your own custom integratio would need to complete in order to get an authenticated iD and record access permission.\n\n\nOAuth 2.0\n \n\n\nGetting an Authenticated iD and record access permission from a user involves following \nOAuth 2.0\n, an industry-standard protocol for authorization. OAuth allows a user to give a website or application access to account information stored on another site, without giving that site their password. \n\n\nIf you've ever signed into a site using Google or Facebook instead of your credentials for that particular site, you've already used OAuth!\n\n\nThe OAuth process includes 3 steps:\n\n\n\n\nCreate an authorization URL\n\n\nGet an authorization code\n\n\nExchange the authorization code for an access token\n\n\n\n\nGet API credentials\n\n\nAPI credentials consisting of a \nclient ID\n and a \nclient secret\n are needed in order to get Authenticated iDs and/or user permissions.\n\n\nTo get Authenticated iDs, you can use Public or Member API credentials. To get permission to read non-public information or add/update researchers' ORCID records, you'll need Member API credentials. To request API credentials, see \nRequest API credentials\n\n\nFor this workshop, we'll use a set of demo credentials:\n\n\nclient_id: APP-XA6KUTFCVQL0622C\nclient_secret: 7c8d6b1b-401b-4f5d-9b8b-b8108c6e197c\n\n\n\n\n(Demo client secret created for this workshop - do not share API client secrets!)\n\n\nCreate an authorization URL\n\n\nTo kick off the OAuth process, we'll need to create an special authorization URL that sends users to an ORCID sign-in screen. This URL consists of \nAuthorization endpoint\n, plus \nParameters\n that identify your organization and the permissions you want to request.\n\n\nAuthorization endpoint (Sandbox)\n\n\nhttps://sandbox.orcid.org/oauth/authorize\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclient_id\n\n\nYour Member or Public API client ID (issued by ORCID)\nTo request API credentials, see \nRequest API credentials\n\n\nAPP-XA6KUTFCVQL0622C\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresponse_type\n\n\n\n\ncode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscope\n\n\nAPI action(s) you want to request permission for, from the list of \nORCID Scopes\n.\n\n\n/authorize\n \n \n/activities/update\n\n\n\n\n\n\nredirect_uri\n\n\nPage on your site that users will see after they complete the authorization process (must be on the list of allowed redirect URIs you specified when requesting your API credentials)\n\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/oauthplayground\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo request permission to add/update activities (affiliations, funding, works, peer review items) using a demo client ID created for this workshop, our authorization URL will be:\n\n\nhttps://sandbox.orcid.org/oauth/authorize?client_id=APP-XA6KUTFCVQL0622C\nresponse_type=code\nscope=/activities/update\nredirect_uri=https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground\n\n\n\n\nGet an authorization Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a new window or tab, visit\n\n\nhttps://sandbox.orcid.org/oauth/authorize?client_id=APP-XA6KUTFCVQL0622C\nresponse_type=code\nscope=/activities/update\nredirect_uri=https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn ORCID sign-in screen listing the requested permissions will appear; sign into your Sandbox account and click \nAuthorize\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter granting permission, you'll be redirected to the Google OAuth Playground.

Enter the email address / ORCID iD and password for your Sandbox account and click \nSign into ORCID\n. \nYou will only need to complete this step once - in the future you can log directly into ORCID with your institutional account.\n\n  \n\n\nAfter linking your accounts, a message appears at the top of your ORCID record, prompting you to connect your iD to your institution. Click the \nConnect\n button.\n\n  \n\n\nAn ORCID sign-in screen listing the requested permissions will appear; click \nAuthorize\n\n  \n\n\nAfter granting permission, you'll be redirected to the Redirect URI specified for your API credentials - this page should show a success or error message depending on whether \nAuthorize\n or \nDeny\n was clicked, and it should also provide a link back to ORCID and links to your local ORCID resources.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nExchange authorization code for access token \n authenticated iD\n\n\nLike in section 4.1.4 above, an authorization code is attached to the end of the redirect URI, which can be exchanged for an access token and the user's ORCID iD.\n\n  \n \n\n\nVendor systems\n\n\nSome publishing, research information and repository software systems support collecting authenticated iDs and permissions right out of the box.

If you have a DOI for a publication, dataset, or other digital object, you can check its metadata for author ORCID iDs.\n\n\nExample: CrossRef API\n\n\nFor example, using the \nCrossRef REST API\n, we can find an author's ORCID iD in the DOI metadata for \nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/364301\n \n\n\n\n\nIn a new window or tab, visit \nhttps://api.crossref.org/v1/works/10.1155/2013/364301\n\n\nIn the JSON data that appears, ORCID iDs submitted by the publisher in the DOI metadata are included in the \nauthor\n element.",
